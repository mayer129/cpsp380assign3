## Program Purpose
"The objective of this assignment is to understand the use of threads and how threads can be used
in multithreaded programs."
## Steps to Compile & Run:
1. Path to the mcarlo directory
2. type `gcc mcarlo.c -o mcarlo` to compile the program
3. type `./mcarlo <integer>`
* This will compile the program. The program will take command line input in the form of an integer, and use that to approximate Pi.
